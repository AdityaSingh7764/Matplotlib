# Seaborn 

Welcome to my **Seaborn Learning Repository**
This repository contains my complete hands on learning and exploration of **Seaborn**, a powerful data visualization library in Python built on top of Matplotlib.

## About the Project

This project documents my journey of mastering Seaborn from basic plots to advanced visualization techniques.  
I explored how to use Seaborn for creating clean, attractive, and informative statistical graphics.

The learning is divided into two main notebooks:

1. **`25_Seaborn.ipynb`** – Introduction to Seaborn  
   - Understanding Seaborn setup and styling  
   - Basic plots: `scatterplot`, `lineplot`, `barplot`, `countplot`  
   - Working with categorical data  
   - Customizing colors, themes, and aesthetics

2. **`26_Advance_Seaborn.ipynb`** – Advanced Seaborn Techniques  
   - Pair plots, joint plots, and heatmaps  
   - Facet grids and categorical plots  
   - Combining multiple plots  
   - Advanced customization and styling  
   - Correlation visualizations and advanced dataset exploration
